                                Soon, miners will be armed with life-saving smartphones on their wrists with which they can make audio and video calls and 
                                alert people when in need of help while at work deep in the bowels of the earth.<br><br>

                                A Bengaluru-based start-up, EasyM2M, has designed and manufactured a smartphone watch called the 'SmartKavach' 
                                which is actually a smartphone but presented in a simple structure of a watch that will become the miner's best friend. 
                                The 'SmartKavach' has a micro sim card slot along with 4GB ROM which can be expandable to 32 GB. It is 3G with Bluetooth and 
                                Wi-Fi enabled.<br><br>

                                However, the highlight of this smartphone watch's features which makes it useful to miners is the 'Man Fall Down' alert. 
                                The 'SmartKavach' is attached via Wi-Fi to the surface office (office on the surface kilometres above them).
                                When a miner is wearing the device and goes underground, his heart rate and blood pressure are constantly monitored. 
                                If the person falls, the device waits for five seconds and then alerts the surface office on the miner's plight. 
                                If he has met with an accident, immediate help is sent to rescue him.<br><br>

                                Priya Rajan Kumar, founder and CTO, EasyM2M, said, "Studies show that every third day, a miner dies in India. 
                                One of the major causes for it is not having a facility to make emergency calls. 
                                My company will make sure that the Wi-Fi system has the appropriate range and is at all times connected to the 'SmartKavach'. 
                                The device is currently being tested; once it is tested for at least six months, 
                                we will approach other mines as well to make use of our product."<br>

                                EasyM2M Technologies has tied up with the Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL) to launch the WiFi service and wrist phones.

                               Mining is a dangerous profession with a fatality rate. Everyone involved is aware of this fact – government, 
                               mining companies and the miners themselves. 45% of the accidents are due to collapsing mine ceilings, explosions due to 
                               methane gas leaks and electricity malfunctions. Moreover, it’s difficult to provide timely medical care to trapped and injured 
                               miners. However, little has been done so far to ensure better safety measures or remedy the situation. <br><br>

                                India-based EasyM2M Technologies has introduced underground Wi-Fi facility for Eastern Coalfields (ECL) mines in a bid to help 
                                workers communicate with their officials in the control rooms.<br><br>

                                As part of its service, EasyM2M will also introduce wrist phones for ECL workers to enable real-time tracking, ET reported.<br><br>

                                EasyM2M Technologies founder Priya Ranjan Kumar told media sources: "One miner dies every third day. 
                                A lot of time is lost in miners trying to communicate to the surface during an accident, emergency, 
                                or even for quick advice on how to fix a machine."<br><br>

                                According to Kumar, Indian miners working in underground and open-cast mines are usually provided with a phone or 
                                an intercom device so that they can interact with the monitoring and control rooms, which are not reliable and rarely work.<br><br>

                                In order to support the SmartKavach features, EasyM2M built wireless mesh networks that eliminate the traditional coal mine 
                                monitoring systems.
