                                    Website Use Information: Like many websites, we and our third-party partners analyze log file information and other data collected through cookies, web beacons, 
                                    and other tracking technology, to collect information about your browsing behavior when you visit our Site, including for example, your browser type, domains,

                                    on the service, etc. We use session cookies to keep you logged in while you use features of our Site; these disappear after you close your browser. We also use

                                    Site, products, and services. In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Site. We track this click-through data to help

                                    Third-Party Sites and Features: Our Site may contain links to other websites operated by third parties and may include social media features such as Facebook and 
                                    Twitter buttons (such as “Like,” “Tweet” or “Pin”). These third-party sites may collect information about you if you click on a link and the social media sites 
                                    may automatically record information about your browsing behavior every time you visit a site that has a social media button. Your interactions with these

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Under no circumstance do we share personal information for any commercial or marketing purpose unrelated to the delivery of EasyM2M Products and 
                                    services without asking you first. Period. We do not rent or sell our customer lists.<br>
                                        The following are the limited situations where we may share personal information:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    1): With your explicit consent: We may share personal information when we have your consent. One example of this would be if you sign up for programs offered by our partners 
                                    (e.g., energy or insurance companies). If you do this, we may share certain information with the partner. This could include things like your enrollment 
                                    information and the activation status of your device. Similarly, when you connect third-party devices and services to your EasyM2M Products through the Works 
                                    with EasyM2M program, you are shown information about any proposed exchange of data. Your explicit consent is required to allow these exchanges on your behalf 
                                    and you can change your mind at any time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    2): For external processing: We have vendors, service providers, and technicians who help with some of our processing and storage, including helping to answer your questions. 
                                    They may also assist with monitoring our servers for technical problems. These technicians (as well as EasyM2M employees) can access certain information about 
                                    you or your account in line with this work but these technicians are not allowed to use this data for non-EasyM2M purposes. We also have strict policies and 
                                    technical barriers in place to prevent unauthorized employee access to video data.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    3): As part of business transitions: Upon the sale or transfer of the company and/or all or part of its assets, your personal information may be among the 
                                    items sold or transferred. We will request a purchaser to treat our data under the privacy statement in place at the time of its collection.
                                </p>    
                                <p>
                                    4): For legal reasons: We may provide information to a third party if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so for legal reasons.                                     
                                </p><br>
                                <p>
                                    We may share non-personal information (for example, aggregated or anonymized customer data) publicly and with our partners. For example, 
                                    we may publish trends about energy use or elevated carbon monoxide levels in the home. This information may also be shared with other users to 
                                    help them better understand their energy usage compared to others in the EasyM2M community, raise awareness about safety issues, or help us generally 
                                    improve our system. We may also share non-personal information with our partners, for example, if they are interested in providing demand-response 
                                    services or other incentive programs. We take steps to keep this non-personal information from being associated with you and we require our partners 
                                    to do the same.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Your personal information may be collected, processed and stored by EasyM2M or its service providers in the United States and other countries 
                                    where our servers reside. As a result, your personal information may be subject to legal requirements, including lawful requirements to 
                                    disclose personal information to government authorities, in those jurisdictions.
                                </p>

                                    our security measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. In the event that any information under our control is compromised 
                                    as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals 
                                    whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.

                                    You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account login information and for all activities that occur under your Account. 
                                    You agree to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your Account, 
                                    and to maintain your password securely to prevent others from gaining access without your permission. You agree to immediately notify

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    3. Access to Services<br>
                                    (a) Access and Use. Subject to these Terms, EasyM2M grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive, right (without the right to sublicense) to access and
                                     use the Services by (i) using the Web Apps in connection with, and solely for the purpose of, controlling and monitoring the Products installed 
                                     on your property or otherwise accessing a service explicitly provided by EasyM2M for your use (the “Permitted Purpose”), and (ii) installing and 
                                     using the Mobile Apps solely on your own handheld mobile device (e.g., iPhone, iPad, or Android smartphone) and solely for the Permitted Purpose, 
                                     and (iii) if separately authorized, access the MyEnergy Service through an authorized MyEnergy account and the interface provided by EasyM2M.<br><br>

                                    (b) Automatic Software Updates. EasyM2M may from time to time develop patches, bug fixes, updates, upgrades and other modifications to improve the 
                                    performance of the Services and/or the Product Software (“Updates”). These may be automatically installed without providing any additional notice
                                     or receiving any additional consent. You consent to this automatic update. If you do not want such Updates, your remedy is to terminate your 
                                     Account and stop using the Services and the Product. If you do not terminate a previously created Account, you will receive Updates automatically. 
                                     You acknowledge that you may be required to install Updates to use the Services and the Product and you agree to promptly install any Updates EasyM2M 
                                     provides. Your continued use of the Services and the Product is your agreement – (i) to these Terms with respect to the Services, and (ii) to the 
                                     End User License Agreement with respect to updated Product Software.<br><br>

                                     (c) Interface to Third Party Products and Services. Over time, EasyM2M may provide the opportunity for you to interface the Products and Services to one 
                                     or more third party products and services, through and using the Services, for example through the Works with EasyM2M platform 
                                     (“Third Party Products and Services”). You decide whether and with which Third Party Products and Services you want to interface. 
                                     Your explicit consent and authorization is required for this interface, and is revocable by you at any time. Once your consent is given for a particular Third 
                                     Party Product and Service, you agree that EasyM2M may exchange information and control data regarding you and your products, including your personal information, 
                                     in order to enable the interface you have authorized. Once this information is shared with the particular Third Party Product and Service, its use will be 
                                     governed by the third party's privacy policy and not by EasyM2M's privacy documentation. You acknowledge and agree that EasyM2M makes no representation or warranty 
                                     about the safety of any Third Party Products or Services. Accordingly, EasyM2M is not responsible for your use of any Third Party Product or Service or any 
                                     personal injury, death, property damage (including, without limitation, to your home), or other harm or losses arising from or relating to your use of any 
                                     Third Party Products or Services. You should contact the third party with any questions about their Third Party Products and Services.<br><br>

                                     transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purposes whatsoever any Content or third party submissions 
                                     or other proprietary rights not owned by you: (i) without the express prior written consent of the respective owners, and (ii) in any way that violates 
                                     any third party right. EasyM2M reserves the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon

                                     with the Services. Any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Services shall be subject to these Terms.<br><br>

                                            (a) Intended Use of EasyM2M Services. The Services are intended to be accessed and used for non-time-critical information and 
                                            control of EasyM2M products. While we aim for the Services to be highly reliable and available, they are not intended to be 
                                            reliable or available 100% of the time. The Services are subject to sporadic interruptions and failures for a variety of 
                                            reasons beyond EasyM2M’s control, including Wi-Fi intermittency, service provider uptime, mobile notifications and carriers, 
                                            among others. You acknowledge these limitations and agree that EasyM2M is not responsible for any damages allegedly caused by 
                                            the failure or delay of the Services to reflect current status or notifications.

                                            alone or when interfaced with third-party products or services are not certified for emergency response. EasyM2M makes no warranty

                                            in the home, and they are no substitute for emergency services. All life threatening and emergency events should be directed to the 
                                            appropriate response services.

                                    <li>(a) Contact EasyM2M First. If a dispute arises between you and EasyM2M, our goal is to learn about and address your concerns. You agree that you 
                                    will notify EasyM2M about any dispute you have with EasyM2M regarding these Terms or our Products or Services by contacting EasyM2M.</li>

                                    <li>(b) Binding Arbitration. You and EasyM2M agree, subject to clause 
                                    11(c) (Protection of Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Rights), to 
                                    submit any claim, dispute, action, cause of action, issue, or request for relief arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of 
                                    the Services to binding arbitration rather than by filing any lawsuit in any forum other than set forth in this section. Further you agree 
                                    arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court. You also waive your right to any form of appeal, 
                                    review or recourse to any court or other judicial authority, insofar as such waiver may be validly made. This provision is intended 
                                    to be interpreted broadly to encompass all disputes or claims arising out of or relating to your use of the Service. Subject to clause 
                                    11(c) (Protection of Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Rights), any dispute or claim made by you against us or us against you arising out of 
                                    or relating to these Terms or your use of the Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory)
                                     will be resolved by binding arbitration except that you may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such a court.</li>

                                    <li>(c) Arbitration Procedures. You must first present any claim or dispute to us by contacting EasyM2M to allow us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. 
                                    You may request arbitration if your claim or dispute cannot be resolved within 60 days after presenting the claim or dispute to EasyM2M. EasyM2M may 
                                    request arbitration against you at any time after it has notified you of a claim or dispute in accordance with clause 11(f) (Notifications). 
                                    The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be conducted in accordance with the then current and applicable rules of the Indian Arbitration 
                                    Association as modified by this agreement. The place of any arbitration will be Bangaluru, India and will be conducted in the English 
                                    language. Claims will be heard by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator may not award relief in excess of or contrary to what this agreement provides, 
                                    order consolidation or arbitration on a class wide or representative basis, award punitive or consequential damages or any other damages aside from 
                                    the prevailing party’s actual damages, or order injunctive or declaratory relief, except that the arbitrator may award on an individual basis damages 
                                    required by statute and may order injunctive or declaratory relief pursuant to an applicable consumer protection statute. Any arbitration shall be 
                                    confidential, and neither you, nor EasyM2M nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be 
                                    required by law or for purposes of enforcement or appeal of the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court 
                                    having proper jurisdiction. If any portion of this arbitration clause is determined by a court to be inapplicable or invalid, then the remainder 
                                    shall still be given full force and effect.</li>

                                    <li>(d) No Class Actions. There shall be no right or authority for any claims subject to this arbitration clause to be arbitrated on a class action or 
                                    consolidated basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public 
                                    (including, but not limited to, as a private attorney general).</li>

                                    <li>(e) Fees and Expenses. All administrative fees and expenses of arbitration will be divided equally between you and EasyM2M. 
                                    Each party will bear the expense of its own counsel, experts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of evidence at the 
                                    arbitration hearing.</li>

                                    <li>(f) YOU MUST CONTACT EasyM2M WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE, 
                                    OR YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIM BASED UPON SUCH EVENT, FACTS, OR DISPUTE.</li>

                                        to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms 
                                        are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, 
                                        the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and 
                                        enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Neither party is an agent or partner of the other party.</li>

                                    <li>Assignment. These Terms, and any associated rights or obligations, may not be assigned or otherwise transferred by you 
                                        without EasyM2M’s prior written consent. These Terms may be assigned by EasyM2M without restriction. These Terms are binding 
                                        upon any permitted assignee.</li>
